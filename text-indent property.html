        Rolls and Royce first met on 4 May 1904 in Manchester. Within minutes of seeing Royce's twin-cylinder 10hp, Rolls knew he had found what he was looking for. After taking the motor car for a drive, Rolls agreed on the spot to sell as many motor cars as Royce could build, under the name Rolls-Royce.
