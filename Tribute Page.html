            <h1 id="title-apj"> About The Legend</h1>

            <p>
                ->  Greats are not born every day; they are born once in a century and are remembered for millennials to
                    come. One such great, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam, was born in Rameswaram of Madras Presidency on 15th October
                    1931 to a poor Tamil Muslim family. He lived with his family in the temple city of Tamilnadu,
                    Rameswaram, where his father, Jainulabdeen, had a boat and was an imam of a local mosque. At the same
                    time, his mother, Ashiamma, was a housewife. Kalam had four brothers and one sister in his family, from
                    which he was the youngest. Kalam's ancestors were wealthy traders and landowners and had vast land and
                    property tracts. But with time, their business of ferrying pilgrims and trading groceries suffered huge
                    losses due to the Pamban Bridge's opening. As a result, Kalam's family had become inadequate and
                    struggled hard to make a living. At a tender age, Kalam had to sell newspapers to supplement his family
                    income.<br><br>


                ->  Educational Background of Abdul Kalam
                    Although Kalam had average grades in school, he was very hard working and had an immense desire to
                    learn. He spent a lot of time studying and had developed a particular interest in mathematics. Kalam
                    left Schwartz higher secondary school after completing his early education and went to Saint Joseph's
                    College, Tiruchirapalli. From Saint Joseph's College, he graduated in physics in 1954. He moved to
                    Madras in 1955 to study aerospace engineering at Madras Institute of Technology.<br><br>


                ->  Kalam as a Scientist
                    Kalam joined as a scientist in the aeronautical development establishment of DRDO in 1960, after
                    graduation. His career started with him designing a small hovercraft. However, he was not convinced by
                    his choice of a job at the DRDO. Kalam was transferred to ISRO in 1969, where he was the project
                    director of India's first satellite vehicle launch. The satellite vehicle deployed the Rohini satellite
                    successfully in near-Earth orbit in July 1980. Kalam received the Government's LV and Slv projects
                    between the 1970s-90s. He directed two projects like Project Devil and Project Valiant, which aimed at
                    developing ballistic missiles from the successful SLV program's technology Kalam somehow convinced
                    Indira Gandhi and sought secret funds for these aerospace projects. His research and immense knowledge
                    brought him and the nation great laurels in the 1980s.<br><br>


                ->  Kalam then went on to become the scientific advisor of the defence minister in 1992 and served at the
                    same post for five years before getting promoted to the post of principal scientific advisor to the
                    government. His immense role in the country's 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear
                    power. Kamal had now become a national hero, to be remembered for ages to come. However, the tests he
                    conducted caused a huge uproar in the international community. Kamal put forward a nationwide plan
                    called Technology Vision 2020, which according to him, was a fantastic way for transforming the stature
                    of India in 20 years, taking it from a developing to a developed nation. The plan envisioned the
                    progress of the nation by adopting advanced technology, expanding healthcare facilities, and emphasizing
                    the education of the masses. <br><br>


                ->  Presidency
                    Sir Kalam was entitled to be the 11th president of India. His term period of 25th July 2002 to 25th July
                    2007 was achieved by winning a presidential election in 2002 with a massive margin of votes. National
                    Democratic Alliances’ nominated him to be president and it was supported by Samajwadi Party and National
                    Congress Party. He was lovingly called as peoples’ president as he had done uncountable works for the
                    welfare of the people and through the entire country. <br><br>
